                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

Oh! i applied to usf too!

                    Why isn't this school more popular?

I don't know much about it, but appartently it has great professors, pretty small classes, good scholarships, and an awesome location--so why hadn't I heard of it until an hour ago?

How easy is it to change your major you applied for after you completed your GE's?

Also, I didn't receive as much financial aid as I needed, but was wondering if the education, location and professors were worth the cost?

And what does it mean that their academic calendar is 4-1-4?  How many classes does a student usually take a semester?

Thanks!

but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

Back to Financial Aid: The Cal and Pell Grants really become the most 'bang for the buck' for low income students who attend CSUs as commuter students making the cost virtually free because of the lowest cost of tuition at that level - and some students get the same financial results at UCs, especially if they hunt for the outside scholarships",0.0

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped
