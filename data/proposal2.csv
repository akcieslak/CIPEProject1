Can an alumni who was on the pre-med track at University of San Francisco tell me how they liked it there?

Do you think USF helped support you and prepare you well for applying and getting into medical school?

Is there anything special they have for pre-med students?

Do they ""weed out"" students in the pre-med track who doesn't have a certain GPA?

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

Oh! i applied to usf too!

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

And what does it mean that their academic calendar is 4-1-4?  How many classes does a student usually take a semester?

Thanks!

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

Can an alumni who was on the pre-med track at University of San Francisco tell me how they liked it there?

Do you think USF helped support you and prepare you well for applying and getting into medical school?

Is there anything special they have for pre-med students?

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

                            haha- believe, usf is unbelievably easy to get into
but then, i attend the high school that's about 2 miles away

i've lived in sf my whole life, and it's great
usf as whole isn't that great of a school, but there are its good points
plus, the view is amazing

it's a mediocre school- i ASSUME that most ppl who attend aren't from the bay area, most ppl in my school either go to a community college, uc, state, or private school outside of cali

as for the student from china- i think that usf isn't academically right for you, it certainly doesn't compare to yale or berkeley or anything- and i don't THINK that there are many foreign students there b/c it's not that prestigious or anything

however, i myself am chinese-american
my parents are immigrants and san francisco has a HUGE chinese population- chinatown is filled with old ladies that speak Cantonese / Taishanese
i've visited china- taisahn, guangzhou, and shanghai- and most ppl in san fran are from guangzhou/taishan- the shops in chinatown are almost exactly like those in china (but let me warn you, chinatown is really dirty)

hope i helped

How easy is it to change your major you applied for after you completed your GE's?

Also, I didn't receive as much financial aid as I needed, but was wondering if the education, location and professors were worth the cost?
